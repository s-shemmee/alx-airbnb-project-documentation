## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents the backend design and architecture for an Airbnb Clone project. It’s part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on planning, modeling, and defining the system before implementation.

You’ll find detailed artifacts like feature breakdowns, diagrams, user stories, and specifications that form the blueprint for backend development.

## ✅ Project Objectives

By the end of this project, the goal is to:

- Identify all backend features and functionalities required for an Airbnb-like system.
- Visualize system interactions via Use Case Diagrams.
- Convert use cases into actionable User Stories for development.
- Map out data flow within the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFD).
- Illustrate process workflows through flowcharts.
- Write detailed technical and functional requirements for backend APIs.

This ensures clarity and alignment before coding begins.

## 📑 Documentation Included

### 1. Features and Functionalities

Comprehensive list of backend features:
- User Authentication
- Property Management
- Booking System
- Payment Processing
- Messaging
- Reviews
- Admin and Analytics

→ Diagram stored in:  
`features-and-functionalities/features-and-functionalities.png`

---

### 2. Use Case Diagram

Visual representation of how users (guests, hosts, admins) interact with the system's backend features.

→ Diagram stored in:  
`use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png`

---

### 3. User Stories

Converts backend functionalities into Agile-friendly user stories, for example:

> "As a user, I want to register an account so I can list my properties."

→ User stories documented in:  
`user-stories/user-stories.md`

---

### 4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Illustrates how data moves through the backend, including processes, data stores, and external entities.

→ Diagram stored in:  
`data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`

---

### 5. System Flowchart

Flowchart detailing one key backend process (in this case we have User Registration).

→ Diagram stored in:  
`flowcharts/flowchart.png`

---

### 6. Requirement Specifications

Technical specifications for at least three major backend features:
- API endpoints
- Request/response examples
- Validation rules
- Performance expectations

→ Requirements documented in:  
`requirements.md`
